# Competitive Programming Resources

The idea is to have a list of hand-picked resources, that can help everyone get into Competitive Programming. Hopefully, will be updated frequently. Suggestions are welcome.

Remember that it is not necessary to go through everything. Pick whatever works for you.

## C++

## Websites / Online Judges

You can register yourself on these Websites/OJs. They have a huge list of problems to solve and blogs to learn from. Some of them will be referenced later on. They also organise contests, where we can compete with others.

- [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com)
	- Beginner friendly
	- Good place to learn basics
- [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/home)
	- AtCoder Beginner Contests (ABCs), as the name suggests, great for beginners
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
	- Weekly contests (Div. 1/2/3/4)
	- Great blogs, everything from basics to advanced
- [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/)
	- Cook-Off, Lunchtime (short contests)
	- Monthly Challenge (long contest)
- [Hackerearth](https://www.hackerearth.com)
	- Monthly Long Challenge
	- Hackathons
- [SPOJ](https://www.spoj.com/)
	- Classical Problems
- [UVa](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/) 
	- [ACM-ICPC](https://icpc.global/) Problems
	- Usually paired up with the book, [Competitive Programming 3 - Steven Halim, Felix Halim](https://cpbook.net/)
- [Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/)
	- Amazing blogs
	- Topcoder SRMs (short contest)
- [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/list/)
	- Good introductory problems

## Algorithms
Important part of CP is to learn algorithms and techniques, practice problems, and to develop algorithmic and constructive thinking.

The best way to progress is to picking an OJ, stick with it and solve problems related to the topics you learn. 

Participate in contests and learn from other people.
