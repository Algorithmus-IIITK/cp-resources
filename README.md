# Competitive Programming Resources

The idea is to have a list of hand-picked resources, that can help everyone get into Competitive Programming. Hopefully, will be updated frequently. Suggestions are welcome.

Remember that it is not necessary to go through everything. Pick whatever works for you.

These are the things I know and/or have heard about.

## Algorithms and Data Structures
Important part of CP is to learn algorithms and techniques, practice problems, and to develop algorithmic and constructive thinking.

The best way to progress is to picking an OJ, stick with it and solve problems related to the topics you learn. 

Participate in contests and learn from other people.

How to start? Pick first few topics from each heading and learn about them one by one.
